## Deployment

### Rollback
On the root folder of the project execute the following command:
``cap deploy:rollback``

Please not that you have to be using the console on your unix virual machine in order to execute this command.

This will try to acess the server so you must have an authorized ssh-key added to your local agent or have the deployer password.
Ensure that everything finishes without errors.
