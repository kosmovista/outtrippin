YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES IF YOU ARE NOT AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD.

<p>THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.</p>

<h4>1. Service</h4>
<h5>1.1. General</h5>
<p>OutTrippin provides an online platform that helps connect customers who wish to purchase Trip plans ("<strong>Customers</strong>") and bloggers, writers and trip planners who wish to provide such Trip plans ("<strong>Experts</strong>"), including, for example, through Trip plan Contests, the Ready-made Trip plan Store, and the Invoice Service (each as defined below and collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). "<strong>User</strong>" means any user of the Site or Service, and may be an Expert or a Customer. To the extent you are a Customer, the provisions in this Agreement regarding Customers apply to you. To the extent you are a Expert, the provisions in this Agreement regarding Experts apply to you. To the extent you are a User, the provisions in this Agreement regarding Users apply to you. "<strong>Selling Expert</strong>" means a winning Expert whose Trip plan Concept is selected by Customer in a Trip plan Contest, or the Expert from whom a Customer purchases a Trip plan Template in the Ready-made Trip plan Store. "<strong>Buying Customer</strong>" means the applicable Customer. "<strong>Sold Trip plan</strong>" means the applicable winning Trip plan Concept or purchased Trip plan Template (and customized version thereof). "<strong>Sale</strong>" means the applicable sale. "<strong>IPR</strong>" means all trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, mask work rights, patents and other intellectual property rights recognized by the laws of any country.</p>

<h5>1.2. Trip plan Contest</h5>
<p>Customer may create a trip plan contest ("<strong>Trip plan Contest</strong>") by creating a trip plan brief ("<strong>Trip plan Brief</strong>"), paying the Customer Payment, and following the other instructions on the Site. There are currently two types of Trip plan Contests: (1) the default Pre-Paid Contest and (2) the Guaranteed Contest. Experts invited by OutTrippin (in OutTrippin' sole discretion) to enter a Trip plan Contest may submit trip plan concepts ("<strong>Trip plan Concepts</strong>") in the format specified by OutTrippin by following the instructions on the Site. Trip plan Concepts must comply with the Trip plan Brief. For Guaranteed Contests, Customer must select one or more winning Trip plan Concepts by a certain time specified by OutTrippin. If no winner is selected in the qualifying round of a Guaranteed Contest, OutTrippin will retain the Customer Payment, OutTrippin will distribute the Expert Fee equally among the Experts who participated in the Guaranteed Contest and who have won a Trip plan Contest in the past, and Customer will have no right to a refund or to use the Trip plan Concepts. If no winner is selected in the final round of a Guaranteed Contest, OutTrippin will retain the Customer Payment, OutTrippin will distribute the Expert Fee equally among the finalists in the final round of the Guaranteed Contest, and Customer will have no right to a refund or to use the Trip plan Concepts. For Pre-Paid Contests, Customer must select one or more winning Trip plan Concepts by the time that the Prepaid Contest closes. Customer may withdraw Prepaid Contest (but not a Guaranteed Contest) for a refund of the Customer Payment before entering the final round and before the close of the Prepaid Contest. Customer may additionally seek a refund of the Customer Payment for a Prepaid Contest (but not a Guaranteed Contest) at any time up to 60 or 90 days after the date of payment for the Prepaid Contest, but only if finalists were not chosen by Customer. For the avoidance of doubt, Buying Customer has no right or license to use any Trip plan Concepts other than the Sold Trip plan. Customer may not: <strong>(a) allow or request Experts to submit Trip plan Concepts to Customer via any means other than via the Site; and (b) colluded in relation to the awarding of a winner in a Trip plan Contest or awarding a separate account held by Customer as the successful Expert in a Trip plan Contest. Customers and Experts must deal on an arm's length basis. Customer may not cancel any Trip plan Contest for the purpose of contracting separately with a Expert Customer meets through the Site which results in Customer avoiding paying OutTrippin any Customer Payment or any fees and charges of OutTrippin.</strong></p>

<h5>1.3. Ready-made Trip plan Store</h5>
<p>Experts may list trip plan templates ("<strong>Trip plan Templates</strong>") for sale in OutTrippin's Ready-made Trip plan Store ("<strong>Ready-made Trip plan Store</strong>"), by creating a listing, uploading the Trip plan Template (in the file format specified by OutTrippin), and following the instructions on the Site. OutTrippin reserves the right to modify and/or remove any Trip plan Templates in its sole discretion (including any Trip plan Template similar to other Trip plan Templates on OutTrippin or other websites, or does not meet OutTrippin quality standards). OutTrippin will set and may modify the selling price of any Trip plan Template. If Expert does not agree with any modifications or pricing, then Expert may remove the Trip plan Template from the Ready-made Trip plan Store. During the time a Trip plan Template is listed for sale in the Ready-made Trip plan Store and for 30 days after removal from the store, Expert hereby grant OutTrippin the exclusive right to market and sell the Trip plan Template (and Trip plans based on the Trip plan Template) and will not market or sell the Trip plan Template (or Trip plans based on the Trip plan Template) other than through OutTrippin.com. Once a Customer purchases a Trip plan Template, Customer may request (in which case the Expert must provide)up to two rounds of customizations to the Trip plan Template for the purposes of inserting Customer's brand name or making minor customizations to the Trip plan Template itself. Expert may refuse to make customizations which are in addition to the forgoing. Expert must deliver each round of customizations to the Customer within 24 hours after receiving the Customer's requests, otherwise OutTrippin may (at its discretion) cancel the sale of the Trip plan Template to the Customer or perform the customizations itself or through its subcontractors, in which case, Expert will forfeit 30% of the Expert Fee for such sale. Customer will be deemed to have accepted the resulting trip plan unless the trip plan does not include the requested customizations and Customer provides notice of rejection to OutTrippin and Expert within 48 hours of delivery of the trip plan. If the defect is not cured within 30 days, Customer will be refunded the Customer Payment and Customer will have no right to use the Trip plan Template or resulting trip plan in any way. If OutTrippin determines, in its sole and absolute discretion that a rejection was unwarranted, then OutTrippin may determine that the Trip plan Template and resulting trip plan is instead accepted by Customer and such determination is final and conclusive.</p>

<h5>1.4. Invoice Service</h5>
<p>For Experts that desire to sell trip plan services outside of the Site, Expert may use the invoice service, including the One-to-One service ("<strong>Invoice Service</strong>") to send invoices for the services to Customers by following the directions on the Site. Customers may request invoices from Experts by following the directions on the Site. OutTrippin reserves the right in its sole discretion to restrict Experts from creating or Customers from requesting invoices using Invoice Services and to remove invoices. OutTrippin will set and may modify the fee for the Invoice Service. If Expert or Customer does not agree with any pricing, then Expert or Customer (as applicable) may cease using the Invoice Services. OutTrippin has no involvement in managing or providing the invoiced trip plan services to the Customer and is simply providing the ability for Expert to invoice and receive payments from Customers, and for Customers to request invoices, using Invoice Services.</p>

<h4>2. License/Assignment</h4>
<h5>2.1. License</h5>
<p>This clause will apply if Buying Customer has purchased a Sold Trip plan pursuant to a Trip plan Contest or from the Ready-made Trip plan Store on a non-exclusive basis. Upon receipt of payment for the Sold Trip plan in the form of OutTrippin Currency Credits, Selling Expert hereby grants to Buying Customer a non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license, without the right to sublicense, to: (i) use, reproduce and distribute the Sold Trip plan; and (ii) sell, assign and/or transfer the foregoing rights to any person. Apart from the foregoing license, Selling Expert reserves all right, title and interest in and to the Sold Trip plan and all IPR therein. Buying Customer may not register the Sold Trip plan as a trademark or service mark with any government authority, nor prevent OutTrippin, the Selling Expert, or any third party from selling, licensing, or using the Sold Trip plan.</p>

<h5>2.2 Representations and Warranties</h5>
<p>Selling Expert represents and warrants that (a) it has all rights necessary (including any third party licenses required) to grant the foregoing license (as applicable) and (b) unless disclosed by Selling Expert when initially submitting the Sold Trip plan to the Trip plan Contest or Ready-made Trip plan Store, Selling Expert represents and warrants that the Sold Trip plan does not contain any IPR licensed from a third party. Selling Expert will indemnify and hold Buying Customer harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any third party claim arising out of a breach by the Selling Trip plan of the foregoing warranty or any third party claim that the Sold Trip plan infringes/misappropriates such party's IPR.
</p>

<h4>3. Payment Terms</h4>
<h5>3.1. Payment and Delivery</h5>
<p>Upon a Sale, Buying Customer will pay the Customer Payment and OutTrippin will pay Selling Expert the Expert Fee (subject to first receiving payment from the Buying Customer), and (b) Selling Expert will upload the Sold Trip plan and OutTrippin will deliver the Sold Trip plan to the Buying Customer, in a format specified by OutTrippin. The "<strong>Customer Payment</strong>" means (i) the price selected by Customer when Customer created a Trip plan Contest as set forth at <%= link_to "http://outtrippin.com", "http://outtrippin.com" %> pricing; (ii) the listed price for the Sold Trip plan in the Ready-made Trip plan Store; or (iii) the invoiced price for trip plan services issued through the Invoice Services. The "<strong>Expert Fee</strong>" means the Customer Payment, minus the fees and charges imposed by OutTrippin and minus any applicable Taxes. Buying Customer will not pay Selling Expert any amount in excess of the Customer Payment for the Sold Trip plan or to pay Selling Expert separately outside the Site in relation to the supply of a Trip plan, or of trip plan services that are the subject of an invoice issued through the Invoice Services.</p>

<h5>3.2. Refunds</h5>
<p>Refunds will be paid to Buying Customer using the same payment methods Buying Customer used to remit the Customer Payment to OutTrippin or via any other method specified by OutTrippin from time to time. If a refund is paid to Buying Customer or a credit card charge back occurs, then: (a) Selling Expert must reimburse OutTrippin for the applicable Expert Fee (the reimbursement will first be paid out of any OutTrippin Credits held by Selling Expert and any remaining debt will be payable by Selling Expert to OutTrippin on demand); and (b) Buying Customer will initially receive the amount of the Customer Payment, less the Expert Fee and will receive the Expert Fee only once the Expert Fee is reimbursed by Selling Expert to OutTrippin.OutTrippin may refund Buying Customers for the following reasons: (i) the Sold Trip plan is Defective; (ii) OutTrippin is required by law or considers that it is required by law to do so; (iii) OutTrippin determines that issuing a refund to the Customer will avoid any dispute or increased costs to OutTrippin; (iv) OutTrippin issues the refund to the Customer in accordance with any refund policy specified by OutTrippin from time to time; (v) the order placed (or request made) by the Customer is found to be fraudulent; (vi) the Customer placed a duplicate order (or request) in error; or (vii) in OutTrippin' sole opinion, OutTrippin considers that it is likely that the refund is necessary to avoid a credit card charge back. OutTrippin' determination as to whether a refund is required is final and conclusive and may not be challenged by you. A Sold Trip plan will be deemed to be "<strong>Defective</strong>" if: (i) Buying Customer and Selling Expert agree it is defective and notify OutTrippin of this fact; (ii) the Sold Trip plan is subject to a third party claim that the Sold Trip plan infringes/misappropriates such party's IPR, that OutTrippin deems (in its sole discretion) is not frivolous; or (iv) OutTrippin deems (in its sole discretion) that the Sold Trip plan is defective.
</p>

<h5>3.3. OutTrippin Credits</h5>
<p>The Expert Fee will be paid to Selling Expert in OutTrippin Credits. There are two types of OutTrippin Credits: (i) Currency Credits, which are equivalent to one unit of the US Dollar and (ii) Bonus Credits, which are not equivalent to any currency. OutTrippin Credits are not legal tender and cannot be traded or sold to third parties. OutTrippin Credits are only exchangeable for Sold Trip plans and services invoiced through the Invoice Service. The balance of any OutTrippin Credits held by you may be reduced at any time by OutTrippin for charge-backs or refunds, or for any amount owing by you to OutTrippin, to compensate OutTrippin for any loss that it determines (in its sole discretion) it has suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement by you. Provided that you are not in breach of this Agreement and your Account is not suspended, you may at any time (and OutTrippin may require you to at any time) convert Currency Credits which you hold in your Account to U.S. dollars or any other currency specified by OutTrippin from time to time. Any such payments will be subject to any minimum or maximum withdrawal amounts set by OutTrippin, may be subject to reasonable withholdings to address charge-backs and refunds, and be made via the payment method specified by OutTrippin from time to time. OutTrippin is not an escrow service and does not hold property on behalf of any person. All amounts deposited or paid to OutTrippin are property of OutTrippin and OutTrippin may use those funds as it sees fit. The only rights that you have to receive payment of any amounts held by OutTrippin are as set out in this Section 3.3. Upon termination of this Agreement, all Bonus Credits will be cancelled immediately and you may convert Currency Credits described above.</p>
